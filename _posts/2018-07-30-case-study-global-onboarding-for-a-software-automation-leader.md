At the cusp of expansion across the globe, Puppet - the Portland-based software automation leader - faced inconsistent employee onboarding experiences and slow time-to-productivity. We were thrilled to be able to work with this trailblazing company to help them refine one area of their business.

When the project began, an over-burdened human resources team needed support joining efforts and solidifying process and consistency across the company. The two teams growing the most - Engineering and Sales - struggled to maintain high-quality knowledge transfer for new hires. In the wake of rapid  change and scale, the team looked to Edify for help.

### Our Approach

Edify took a four-phased approach to building a scalable, employee-driven onboarding program for Puppet.

1. Connect Onboarding to Company Goals
2. Develop “Back of House” Tools to Scaffold the Programs
3. Develop Employee-Centric “Front of House” Resources
4. Design Technical Onboarding for Sales and Engineering

### Project Successes

→  Increased time to productivity  
→  Positive feedback about onboarding experience  
→  Increased communication and trust  
→  Eased tensions and frustrations  
→  Smooth adoption and evolution of program  
→  High stakeholder engagement  
→  On-time deliverables from across the org  
→  Collaborative and open process
