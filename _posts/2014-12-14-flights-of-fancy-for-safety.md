I'm sure you've suffered (sat… I mean, sat) through at least a few terrible in-flight safety demonstrations and videos in your time. Out of all the major US airlines, I can't think of one that's truly nailed the educational aspect of talking about flight safety – remember, the goal here is to make sure people can actually apply what they're being told should a disaster occur.

Air New Zealand has taken the most boring part of every flight and completely re-imagined it. Each year, the country receives thousands of visitors looking to see the landscape of Lord of the Rings for their own eyes. The airline used this crucial part of New Zealand's economy to turn a boring safety talk into a truly engaging, actually fun experience. Take a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOw44VFNk8Y).

While the video was released in 2012, it somehow just got over to the states when [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/tldr/2014/10/25/7067121/air-new-zealands-epic-hobbit-themed-epic-safety-video-is-the-most-fun) covered it recently in October 2014:

"Much like the movie that inspired it, it's an incredibly elaborate affair. While 2012's air safety film was fairly modest, mostly featuring Middle-earth garb and a cameo from Jackson inside the airplane, this year's film was shot all over New Zealand, including the set of Hobbiton, and features a dozens of actors in pretty elaborate costumes, including a host of decked-out orcs and elves."

However, I'm here to talk about the real value of the short film: it's educational design genius. Air New Zealand took what is perhaps the most loathed and boring part about flying and not only shortened it, but also made it wildly entertaining, relevant, and memorable. The key here is that they did the unexpected: when most people board a plane, they know what's coming in terms of the safety demo. They tune out, text while they can, and even start dozing off. They know what to expect, yadda yadda, and have absolutely no interest in paying attention. The filmmakers took advantage of this by providing a completely "out of left field" viewing experience. Since the film opens like a feature film and not like your typical safety video, people actually pay attention. Then it follows through with a real storyline, characters, and drama thrown in here and there. The whole thing is laughable but remarkably charming – the effect intended to motivate viewers to actually remember what they saw in case of an emergency.

What's the takeaway here? Anyone who teaches anything can use this model! The Air New Zealand video provides a great storyline and technique that facilitators, instructors, and designers can use to create more engaging learning experiences. Perhaps you won't theme your next workshop on Lord of the Rings, but I guarantee you that setting a more interesting backdrop will keep your learners awake, alert, and able to apply what you teach them!
