My guest today is Emily Griffith, an absolutely awesome person, whom you’ll see why very soon. Emily is the Ambassador of Awesome at FINE, a brand agency for the digital age. Based in the Portland office, she works fast and goes creatively big, empowering people to create their best version of great, while maintaining grace under fire. Curating a bonafide Awesome office culture is a juggling act of operations, studio management, hospitality, event planning, and communications, and no day is ever the same. Emily knows first impressions are lasting, so she makes them meaningful for both staff and clients, taking FINE’s “bring friends” credo and running barefoot with it. Thanks for joining us, Emily.
