I’m thrilled to welcome Jillian Douglas and Shannon McKenzie today to our podcast, and the fact that they are our first interview just makes my heart so happy. Jillian Douglas and Shannon McKenzie are the co-founders of the Idea Learning Group here, in Portland, Oregon. Idea Learning Group is on a mission to transform workplace learning by providing clients with creative, engaging, and custom learning experiences. I can personally attest to how amazing this pair is, and I’ve been lucky enough for the past few years to have Jillian as a mentor. She’s been absolutely integral in shaping Edify with me, and I can’t imagine growing the company without her mentorship.

Jillian and Shannon share a passion for improving how people learn. After working together for years, beginning in 2002, in the retail and healthcare industries Jillian and Shannon realized they have the same work ethic and would make ideal business partners. Shannon’s technical in business operation’s knowledge compliment Jillian’s creativity and training background perfectly. They’ve developed a brand reflective of their strongly held belief that corporate learning experiences can and should be personal, experiential, and enjoyable.
